This is a repository for test match cricket data collected from https://cricsheet.org/downloads/#experimental 
Male test match cricket data is selected for and downloaded in CSV file format.

This format needs further processing in order to be readable as standard CSV files since each file contains a header with match informatioon containing a different number of columns to the remainder of the file which contains information about each delivery in the match. 'test_match_data_processing' is used to split the header from the remaining information and save each file as a new CSV file with the suffix '_header' and '_stats' respectively.

Note that these statistics are not exhaustive. The records only extend back to 2009. Future updates for new matches occur semi-regularly. The statistics also do not contain fielding data (ie who took a catch, made a runout) or team lists (players on each team for the match).
