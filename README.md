# TestMatchCricketProject
In this project I look at Test Match Cricket data from Cricsheet

Raw csv files are stored in the subfolder /test_csv_male
Processed files are stored in the subfolder /processed_data

## Before you start
Project data is winziped in test_csv_male/raw_csv_files. This needs to be unzipped so each csv file in in the test_csv_male directory. Next test_match_data_processing should be run in order to process these raw files into usable files by the remaining projects.
