    "# Data Importing, Cleaning, and Processing\n",

    "In this project I import test cricket dataset from https://cricsheet.org/. The data contains match records from 2009 and onwards. The mens test data contains 411 csv files as retrieved on 2009/09/26.\n",
    "\n",
    "files are save in test_csv_male sub folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "First the data needs to be loaded. It is contained within a CSV files, however this CSV files themselves are not properly formatted. Within each file there are a number of lines of general match information before the actual table starts. The table itself gives a ball by ball breakdown of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the stats are quite comprehensive in terms of the number of matches and the various ball by ball breakdowns one major drawback is a lack of attributing fielding wickets. Because of this it is not possible to accurately attribute catches or runouts to individual players. Despite this many interesting insights can be gained through this extensive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The csv files from cricksheet are saved in csv format, but do not contain standard columns. Opening one in notepad each csv file seems to compose two parts. The first part contains information about the match. This includes dates, umpires, results etc. The second part of the file contains a ball by ball breakdown of the match. This includes bowler, runs scored, wickets taken etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process each of these csv files I first open them as text documents. The match information and ball by ball breakdown are seperated and stored seperately. I keep the filenames as a \"match id\" which can be used to subsequently join datasets of corresponding matches.\n",
